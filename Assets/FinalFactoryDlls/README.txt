Hello Modder!

DLL's from the main game go here.  You need to use the DLL's from the exact version of the
game that you are creating mods for--major version updates break all mod compatibility.

While we strive to be version agnostic as much as possible in the mod template, sometimes 
breaking changes can cause this template to no longer work for older versions of our
game.  For this reason, if you're trying to make mods for an older version of the game,
you may need to sync to an old revision of this repo to get it to work.
